  (** {3 Field Types}

  val bool : bool t

      mapped to an integer. *)

  (** An [int] mapped to a sufficiently wide integer on the SQL side. *)

  val int64 : int64 t
  (** An [int64] mapped to a [bigint] (64 bits) on the SQL side. *)

  val float : float t
  (** A [float] mapped to [double precision] or (best alternative) on the SQL
      side. Serialization may be lossy (e.g. base 10 may be used), so even if
      both sides support IEEE 754 double precision numbers, there may be
      discrepancies in the last digits of the binary representaton. *)

  val string : string t
  (** An UTF-8 string. The database should accept UTF-8 if non-ASCII characters
      are present. *)

  val octets : string t
  (** A [string] mapped to whichever type is used to represent binary data on
      the SQL side. *)

  val pdate : Ptime.t t
  (** A time truncated to a date and mapped to the SQL [date] type. *)

  val ptime : Ptime.t t
  (** An absolute time with driver-dependent precision. This corresponds to an
      SQL [timestamp with time zone] or a suitable alternative where not
      available:

        - MariaDB has [datetime] which is similar to the SQL [timestamp] and
          [timestamp] which is similar to the SQL [timestamp with time zone],
          but the driver does not make the distinction.  Caqti sets the session
          time zone to UTC to avoid misinterpretation, since time values are
          passed in both directions without time zones.  Values have microsecond
          precision, but you will need to specify the desired precision in the
          database schema to avoid truncation.

        - PostgreSQL supports this type and it's a good option to avoid any time
          zone issues if used conistently both on the client side, in SQL
          expressions, and in the database schema.
          Note that [timestamp with time zone] is stored as UTC without time
          zone, taking up no more space then [timestamp].
          The PostgreSQL [timestamp] type is problematic since how conversions
          work and the manual indicate that it is meant to be a local time, and
          since database columns of this type stores the value without
          conversion to UTC, it becomes prone to time zone changes.
          To mitigate the issue, Caqti sets the time zone of sessions to UTC.

        - Sqlite3 does not have a dedicated type for absolute time.  The date
          and time is sent as strings expressed at the UTC time zone using same
          format that the SQLite {{:https://sqlite.org/lang_datefunc.html}
          datetime} function and [CURRENT_TIMESTAMP] return, except for an
          additional three decimals to achive millisecond precision.

          It might seem better to use standard RFC3339 format, since it is
          accepted by the SQLite functions, but that would misorder some time
          values if mixed with the results of these functions, even just the "Z"
          suffix would misorder values with different precision.

      Date and time values which comes from the database without time zone are
      interpreted as UTC. This is not necessarily correct, and it is highly
      recommended to use SQL types which are transmitted with time zone
      information, even if this is UTC. *)

  val ptime_span : Ptime.span t
  (** A period of time. If the database lacks a dedicated representation, the
      integer number of seconds is used. *)


  (** {3 Composite Types} *)

  val option : 'a t -> 'a option t
  (** [option t] turns a set of fields encoded as [t] into a correspending set
      of nullable fields.  The encoder will encode [None] as into a tuple of
      [NULL] values and the decoder will return [None] if all fields are [NULL].

      If the type [t] itself is [option t'] for some [t'], or contains nested
      tuples and options such that all field types are nested under an option
      type, then it would have been possible to decode an all-[NULL] segment of
      a row as [Some x] where [x] is a corresponding tuple-option-tree
      terminating in [None] values.  The above paragraph resolves this ambiguity
      since it implies that the outermost option possible will be decoded as
      [None]. *)

  val redacted : 'a t -> 'a t
  (** [redacted t] is the same type as [t] but sealed as potentially containing
      sensitive information to be redacted from pretty-printers and logs. *)


  (** {3 Tuple Types}

      As a common case of composite types, constructors for tuples up to 12
      components are predefined here.  Higher tuples can be created with
      {!Row_type.val-product}. *)

  val unit : unit t
  (** A type holding no fields. This is used to pass no parameters and as the
      result for queries which does not return any rows. It can also be nested
      in tuples, in which case it will not contribute to the total number of
      fields. *)
