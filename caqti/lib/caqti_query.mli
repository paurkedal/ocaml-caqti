(** Query specification. *)

type t =
  | L of string (** Literal code. May contain incomplete fragments. *)
  | Q of string (** [Q s] corresponds to a [TEXT] literal; passed as part of the
                    query string if a suitable quoting function is available in
                    the client library, otherwise passed as an additional
                    parameter. *)
  | P of int    (** [P i] refers to parameter number [i], counting from 0. *)
  | E of string (** [E name] is expanded by the environemnt lookup function. *)
  | S of t list (** [S frags] is the concatenation of [frags]. *)
(** A representation of a query string to send to a database, abstracting over
    parameter references and providing nested concatenation to simplify
    generation.  For databases which only support linear parameters (typically
    denoted "[?]"), the driver will reshuffle, elide, and duplicate parameters
    as needed.  *)

val normal : t -> t
(** [normal q] rewrites [q] to a normal form containing at most one top-level
    {!S} constructor, containing no empty literals, and no consecutive literals.
    This function can be used to post-process queries before using {!equal} and
    {!hash}. *)

val equal : t -> t -> bool
(** Equality predicate for {!t}. *)

val hash : t -> int
(** A hash function compatible with {!equal}.  The hash function may change
    across minor versions and may depend on architecture. *)

val pp : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** [pp ppf q] prints a {e human}-readable representation of [q] on [ppf].
    The printed string is {e not suitable for sending to an SQL database}; doing
    so may lead to an SQL injection vulnerability. *)

val show : t -> string
(** [show q] is the same {e human}-readable representation of [q] as printed by
    {!pp}.
    The returned string is {e not suitable for sending to an SQL database};
    doing so may lead to an SQL injection vulnerability. *)

val concat : string -> t list -> t
(** [concat sep frags] is [frags] interfixed with [sep] if [frags] is non-empty
    and the empty string of [frags] is empty. *)

type expand_error
(** A description of the error caused during {!expand} if the environment lookup
    function returns an invalid result or raises [Not_found] for a variable when
    the expansion is final. *)

val pp_expand_error : Format.formatter -> expand_error -> unit
(** Prints an informative error. *)

exception Expand_error of expand_error
(** The exception raised by {!expand} when there are issues expanding an
    environment variable using the provided callback. *)

val expand : ?final: bool -> (string -> t) -> t -> t
(** [expand f q] replaces each occurrence of [E v] some some [v] with [f v] or
    leaves it unchanged where [f v] raises [Not_found]. The [Not_found]
    exception will not escape this call.

    @param final
      If [true], then an error is raised instead of leaving environment
      references unexpended if [f] raises [Not_found].  This is used by drivers
      for performing the final expansion.  Defaults to [false].

    @raise Expand_error
      if [~final:true] is passed and [f] raise [Not_found] or if [f] returns a
      query containing environment references. *)

val angstrom_parser : t Angstrom.t
(** Matches a single expression terminated by the end of input or a semicolon
    lookahead. The accepted languages is described in {{!query_template} The
    Syntax of Query Templates}. *)

val angstrom_parser_with_semicolon : t Angstrom.t
(** A variant of [angstrom_parser] which accepts unquoted semicolons as part of
    the a statement, which is allowed in some cases like for defining SQLite3
    triggers.  This is the parser used by {!Caqti_request}, where it's assumed
    that the input is a single SQL statement. *)

val of_string : string -> (t, [`Invalid of int * string]) result
(** Parses a single expression using {!angstrom_parser_with_semicolon}.  The
    error indicates the byte position of the input string where the parse
    failure occurred in addition to an error message. See {{!query_template} The
    Syntax of Query Templates} for how the input string is interpreted. *)

val of_string_exn : string -> t
(** Like {!of_string}, but raises an exception on error.

    @raise Failure if parsing failed. *)


(** {2 Construction by Pretty-Printing} *)

val qprintf : ('a, Format.formatter, unit, t) format4 -> 'a
(** {!qprintf} allows building Caqti queries using a printf-style interface.

    When using {!qprintf}, you can use the {!pp_query}, {!pp_quote}, {!pp_env}
    and {!pp_param} printers from this module to generate the corresponding
    query fragments.

    In addition, you can use the "Q" and "E" string tags to delimit portions of
    the formatting string that should be interpreted as quotes and environment
    variables, respectively. The "Q" and "E" tags can not be nested: within the
    tags, {!qprintf} behaves no differently than {!Format.asprintf} and will
    generate a string, not a query (only when the tag is closed does the string
    get converted into a query).

    The two following calls to {!qprintf}:
    {[
      qprintf "FUNC(@{<Q>Quoted value with %d format(s)})" 1
    ]}
    and
    {[
      qprintf "FUNC(%a)" pp_quote (Format.asprintf "Quoted value with %d format(s)" 1)
    ]}
    are functionally equivalent. Both compute
    {[
      S [L "FUNC("; Q "Quoted value with 1 format(s)"; L ")"]
    ]}
    but the first one is nicer to work with.

    @raise Failure if the "Q" and "E" tags are nested.
*)

val kqprintf : (t -> 'a) -> ('b, Format.formatter, unit, 'a) format4 -> 'b
(** {!kqprintf} is the continuation-passing version of {!qprintf} (like
    {!Format.kasprintf} for {!Format.asprintf}).

    You usually want [qprintf] instead. *)

val pp_param : Format.formatter -> int -> unit
(** {!pp_param} is a formatter that includes the corresponding parameter in a
    query built by {!qprintf}.

    Note that to include a parameter in a query, {!pp_param} *must* be used:
    using literal ["$"] or ["?"] will be sent as-is to the SQL driver and will
    not be processed by Caqti. *)

val pp_env : Format.formatter -> string -> unit
(** {!pp_env} is a formatter that includes the corresponding environment
    variable in a query built by {!qprintf}.

    Note that to include an environment variable in a query, {!pp_env} *must* be
    used: using literal ["$(...)"] will be sent as-is to the SQL driver and will
    not be processed by Caqti. *)

val pp_quote : Format.formatter -> string -> unit
(** {!pp_quote} is a formatter that includes a TEXT literal in a query built by
    {!qprintf}. *)

val pp_query : Format.formatter -> t -> unit
(** {!pp_query} can be used with {!qprintf} to embed a query that was already
    parsed in the format string. Direct use of {!pp_query} should be rare, and
    {!pp_param}, {!pp_env}, or {!pp_quote} should be used instead when possible.

    Using {!pp_query} with any other formatter will ignore the query and instead
    print a dummy value (currently ["... SQL FRAGMENT ..."]) instead. *)
