(** [uri error] is the URI of the connection used where [error] occurred. *)

(** [show error] is an explanation of [error]. *)

exception Exn of t
(** [Exn error] can be used when an exception is preferred over explicit error
    handling.  The core Caqti API never raises exceptions which originate from
    runtime errors. *)
