(** {2 SQL Primitives} *)

type query =
  | L of string  (** Literal code. May contain incomplete fragments. *)
  | P of int     (** [P i] refers to parameter number [i], counting from 0. *)
  | S of query list (** [S frags] is the concatenation of [frags]. *)
(** A representation of a query string to send to a database, abstracting over
    parameter references and providing nested concatenation to simplify
    generation.  For databases which only support linear parameters (typically
    denoted "[?]"), the driver will reshuffle, elide, and duplicate parameters
    as needed.  *)

val pp_query : Format.formatter -> query -> unit
(** Pretty-print a query with the supplied formatter (for debugging). *)

(** {2 SQL utility functions}

    {b Note.} Since real databases generally do not implement the precise same
    escaping mechanisms, and discrepancies between the escape function and the
    database can lead to SQL injection, the standard SQL escaping functions
    provided below are hardly useful for real applications. *)

val bprint_sql_escaped : Buffer.t -> string -> unit
[@@ocaml.deprecated "Unsuitable for uses with many real databases."]
(** [bprint_sql_escaped buf s] adds an [s] to [buf] with any single quoted
    doubled according to the standard SQL escaping rule.
    @deprecated See note in module introduction. *)

val bprint_sql_quoted : Buffer.t -> string -> unit
[@@ocaml.deprecated "Unsuitable for uses with many real databases."]
(** [bprint_sql_quoted buf s] adds [s] to [buf] as an SQL-quoted string.  Same
    as [bprint_sql_escaped], except surrounded by single quotes.
    @deprecated See note in module introduction. *)

val sql_escaped : string -> string
[@@ocaml.deprecated "Unsuitable for uses with many real databases."]
(** [sql_escaped s] is [s] with single-quotes doubled according to the
    standard SQL escaping rule.
    @deprecated See note in module introduction. *)

val sql_quoted : string -> string
[@@ocaml.deprecated "Unsuitable for uses with many real databases."]
(** [sql_quoted s] is [sql_escaped s] between a pair of single quotes.
    @deprecated See note in module introduction. *)
