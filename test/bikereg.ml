(* This is an example of how to use Caqti directly in application code.
 * This way of defining typed wrappers around queries should also work for
 * code-generators. *)

(* This is an example of a custom type, but it is experimental for now.  The
 * alternative is to use plain tuples, as the other queries below, and coverting
 * in client code. *)

(* Query Strings
 * =============
 *
 * Queries are normally defined in advance.  This allows Caqti to emit
 * prepared queries which are reused throughout the lifetime of the
 * connection. *)

(* Wrappers around the Generic Execution Functions
 * ===============================================
 *
 * Here we combine the above queries with a suitable execution function, for
 * convenience and to enforce type safety.  We could have defined these in a
 * functor on CONNECTION and used the resulting module in place of Db. *)

(* Db.exec runs a statement which must not return any rows.  Errors are
 * reported as exceptions. *)

let report_stolen (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) frameno =
  Db.exec Q.report_stolen frameno

(* Db.find runs a query which must return at most one row.  The result is a
 * option, since it's common to seach for entries which don't exist. *)
let find_bike_owner frameno (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) =
  Db.find_opt Q.select_owner frameno

(* Db.iter_s iterates sequentially over the set of result rows of a query. *)

  Db.iter_s Q.select_stolen f ()

let iter_s_description desc (module Db : Caqti_lwt.CONNECTION) f =

(* There is also a Db.iter_p for parallel processing, and Db.fold and
 * Db.fold_s for accumulating information from the result rows. *)
